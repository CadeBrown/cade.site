# Hey! I'm Cade Brown

Welcome to [Near Computronium](/), my personal website and blog ([cade.site/blog](/blog)). My main interests are mathematics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, programming languages, and data-driven art. I like to write tutorials from scratch, and deep-dives into mathematical/philosophical topics. I also write about practical tips and tricks I've learned the hard way, so hopefully you don't have to.

Check out projects I've worked on: [MAGMA](https://icl.utk.edu/magma/), [CARVE](https://carve.cade.site), [kscript](https://kscript.org), [SimpleSummit](https://simplesummit.github.io/blog/fractalexplorer), [OEIS A267263](https://oeis.org/A267263), [MPFR](https://mpfr.org). Previously, I've worked at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), [OLCF @ ORNL](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/), [ICL @ UTK](https://icl.utk.edu/about), PAIRS @ UTK, and open source communities.

# My Music

## Dysmorphic Demiurge

I'm the vocalist for **Dysmorphic Demiurge**, a death metal band based in Knoxville, TN. We're unlike most death metal bands; our songs deal with the rise of artificial intelligence, the philosophical repercussions of achieving [The Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), and apocalyptic scenarios ([BUY OUR MERCH!](https://miasmarecords.com/collections/dysmorphic-demiurge)).

We're completely self-recorded, self-mixed, and self-mastered, and our crazy artwork courtesy of Justin Abraham [@artofjustinabraham](https://www.instagram.com/artofjustinabraham). We're signed to **Miasma Records**.

# My Software

[LWN: Python and the Infinite](https://lwn.net/Articles/833624/)
: My opinions and suggestions on some of Python's mathematical inconsistencies. TL;DR: add `inf` and `nan`, and change how math-based exceptions are structured.
